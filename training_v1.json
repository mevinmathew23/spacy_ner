All parties involved were arrested and charged with criminal fraud and misrepresentation of accounting records. \n        The FBI subsequently seized the company's assets and placed an injunction on the business to prevent any further fraud or criminal activity from taking place. An independent auditor was then hired to review the company's records and reconstruct accurate financial statements. \n        The investigation is still ongoing and additional charges may be pending as agents continue to analyze the financial records to determine the scope of the alleged crimes."

The officers reported that Smith's speech was slurred and her gait unsteady, as if she had been drinking heavily.\n        Upon further investigation, officers found an empty bottle of hard liquor beside Smith and noticed an odor of alcohol coming from her person. Smith was unable to provide a convincing explanation as to why she had been in public while intoxicated.\n        Police searched the vicinity and found surveillance records proving that Smith had been at a nearby bar until nearly 4:00 AM. Further interviews with staff and other patrons of the bar led to detectives forming a suspicion that Smith had been publicly intoxicated prior to being noticed by the patrol officers.\n        The investigation into the public intoxication is ongoing, with efforts focused on identifying potential witnesses to the incident and gathering sufficient evidence to support any potential charges."
