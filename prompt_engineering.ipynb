Accurate: Accuracy is achieved by carefully, precisely, and honestly reporting of all relevant information.\\n\\n3. Clear: A police report speaks for the reporting officer when he or she is not present. There\\nshould be no doubt or confusion regarding what happened during an incident or crime,\\nbased upon the content of a police report.  Clarity in report writing is achieved by clear and\\nlogical organization of information, the judicious use of simple, common, and first person\\nlanguage, and effective writing mechanics.\\n\\n4. Concise.  Reports should be brief but also contain all relevant information necessary for a\\ncomplete understanding of the crime or incident, without additional explanation.   Brevity\\nshould never take precedence over accuracy, completeness, or clarity in report writing.\\n\\n5. Complete. A complete report will contain all the relevant facts, information, and details that\\nthe reader will need to have in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the crime\\nor incident described in the report.  The report is complete when it is a complete word\\npicture of the incident, there are no questions left unanswered by the reader, officer actions\\nare explained and justified by the contents of the report, and both supporting and\\nconflicting information is included.\\n\\n6. Timely. No decisions can be made or actions taken regarding an arrest or request for follow\\nup investigation if a report is not submitted in a timely fashion.  \\n\\n'"
